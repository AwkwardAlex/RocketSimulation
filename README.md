## RocketSimulation project

#### Description
This is a simple project simulating rocket launch.
This project uses inner and abstract classes, inheritance, enums and interfaces.

#### Set-up guide
- Open terminal
- Download the branch with the use of ```git clone https://github.com/AwkwardAlex/RocketSimulation.git```
- compile RocketSimulation.java by typing command ```javac RocketSimulation.java```
- Enter command ```java RocketSimulation [int destination] [int power] [int mass]```

Destination is the distance that you want to fly, power and mass are variables
used to calculate actual travel distance.

#### Example
```java RocketSimulation 10000 200 100```

App will calculate actual travel distance and compare it with desired distance.
In addition, app will output what solar body is accessible with actual travel distance.
